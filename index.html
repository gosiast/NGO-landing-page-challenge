    <h1>This is a Landing Page of a Zero Pięć Polish foundation to help kids with mental health problems</h1>
<main>
    The Young Children's Mental Health Foundation was established in early 2008 as a non-profit organization.
We are a team of psychologists who have been expanding their knowledge and competences in therapeutic support for families with small children for many years, especially in crisis situations, emotional or developmental difficulties. We provide consultations and advice, we conduct therapy aimed at supporting the child-parent relationship, based on the rich global clinical and scientific knowledge. We are close to understanding development in the context of the key role of the child's relationship with his loved ones, taking into account the conscious and unconscious processes involved in it (attachment theory and psychoanalysis). It is important for us to gain more and more knowledge about the conditions of proper development, but we also deal with the mechanisms of its disturbances and disorders that affect the mental health of young children. We are guided by the idea of ​​preventive intervention, because thanks to preventive actions and early assistance, it is possible to counteract the deepening and consolidation of difficulties that may interfere with the child's development.
By supporting children and their families, we cooperate with other institutions, organizations and individual specialists. We also conduct training, lectures and supervision for them. In our work, we try to care for high ethical and professional standards, which is why we constantly expand our professional competences by participating in specialist training and using the supervision of Dr. Stella Acquarone, founder and director of the Parent-Infant Clinic and School of Infant Mental Health in London.
